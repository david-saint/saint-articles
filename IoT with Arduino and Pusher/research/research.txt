Install the Board definition [depending on the board you are using | I am using MKR1000]
	Tools | Boards | Boards Manger 
	Then search for your board..
	Install it then select it in the Tools | Boards

Get a shield for the arduino board. 
A shield is basically an extension board that can be placed on top of the Arduino board
There are many types of shields:
	1. Ethernet Shield.
	2. Wifi Shield.
	3. 3G or LTE Shields.
The MKR1000 board comes with a built in Wifi chip.

In order to use the wifi chip on the arduino board we have to install a library.
Go to Sketch | Include Library | Manage Libraries  then search for and install wifi101

To test you can open Files | Examples | WiFi | ConnectWithWpa



GRABBING CONTENT FROM THE CLOUD
There are 6 steps to achieve this..
	1. Specify the the webpage 
		char server[] = "www.example.com"
	2. Create an instance of WiFI client
		WiFiClient client;
	3. In the setup() function we connect to the server and make a request
		if(client.connect(server, 80)){
			Serial.println("connected to the server");
			//Then we make a request
			client.println("GET / HTTP/1.1");
			client.println("Host: www.example.com");
			client.println("Connection: close");
			client.println();
		}
	4. Inside the loop() function we read the data coming back from the server
		while(client.available()) {
			char c = client.read();
			Serial.write(c);
		}
	5. We then stop the connection		
		if(!client.connected()){
			Serial.println();
			Serial.println("disconnected from the server.");
			client.stop();
			while(true);
		}

SENDING DATA TO THE CLOUD 


// Close existing connection
client.stop();
// Connect & send request
if (client.connect(server, 80)) {
Serial.println("connecting...");
// Send the HTTP PUT request:
client.println("GET /dweet/for/myarduino?light=" +
String(sensorData) + " HTTP/1.1");
client.println("Host: dweet.io");
client.println("User-Agent: ArduinoWiFi/1.1");
client.println("Connection: close");
client.println();
// Note the time that the connection was made:
lastConnectionTime = millis();
}
else {
// if you couldn't make a connection:
Serial.println("connection failed");
}
