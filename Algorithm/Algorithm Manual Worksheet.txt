The First step to solving an algorithm is to determine the type of problem you are dealing with

Three desirable properties of a good algorithm.
	- correct
	- efficient
	- easy to implement

A proper mathematical proof consists of several parts. First, there is a clear,
precise statement of what you are trying to prove. Second, there is a set of assumptions
of things which are taken to be true and hence used as part of the proof.
Third, there is a chain of reasoning which takes you from these assumptions to the
statement you are trying to prove

If your idea is not clearly revealed when you express an algorithm, then you are using too
low-level a notation to describe it

Problem specifications have two parts: 
	(1) the set of allowed input instances, and 
	(2) the required properties of the algorithm’s output

Good counter-examples have two important properties:
	- verifiability
	- simplicity
